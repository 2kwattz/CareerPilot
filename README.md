Why CareerPilot?

Every year more than 6 crore of Indian graduates from diverse background and with diversity in
education.Almost similar number of students enter into colleges for taking various education to help them in
seeking jobs. The aim is to create an integrated platform in order to send National and International Scholarships, Job Alerts, grants,
Training, Certifications and Course recommendations and similar works based on their preference

In existing system, not all educational resources such as scholarship details, hackathons, job alerts
are available  on a single portal, and this can have disadvantages for students as well as graduates
One of the main disadvantages of not keeping all scholarship details on a single portal is that it can
be time consuming and confusing for students to navigate multiple platforms. Students may have to
create accounts and profiles on multiple portals, which can be time-consuming and can lead to information overload.
Additionally, students may miss out on scholarship opportunities if they are not aware of all the available portals
and databases Another disadvantage is that the information on different portals may not be consistent or up-to-date.
Students may find conflicting information on different portals, which can be confusing and frustrating.
Additionally, portals may not always be updated with the latest scholarship opportunities, deadlines, and eligibility
criteria, which can lead to students missing out on valuable opportunities.

Code Analysis

Structure and Modularity: The code is structured into sections and modules, which is a good practice for code organization. 
It separates concerns by importing modules for different functionalities, defining routes, and initializing middleware. This modular approach enhances code readability 
and maintainability.

Use of Dependencies: The code imports several dependencies to handle various tasks such as web scraping, database operations, authentication, email sending, etc. 
Utilizing existing libraries and modules is generally considered a professional practice as it saves time and leverages the expertise of others.

Documentation: While the code lacks extensive comments, there are some comments explaining the purpose of certain sections or modules. However, more detailed comments
 describing the functionality, inputs, and outputs of functions would enhance the code's maintainability.

Code Reusability: The code uses middleware, routers, and separate modules for different tasks, promoting code reusability. This is a good practice as it allows for easier
 maintenance and encourages the use of modular components.

Error Handling: The code does not have extensive error handling. It could benefit from implementing try-catch blocks or error middleware to handle exceptions and provide
 appropriate error messages to users.

Security: The code includes some security-related features like password hashing using bcrypt and authentication using JWT. These features indicate a professional approach to security.

Scalability: The code does not provide explicit indications of scalability considerations. However, by using a framework like Express.js and separating concerns into modules,
 it lays a foundation that can be expanded upon to handle more complex and scalable applications.
